                                without any previous papers to work from. He explained every detail and showed some

                                make the

                                    First of all, unplug all the appliances from whole property sockets and try to reset
                                    the RCD if RCD
                                    reset back then you
                                    don't need to go any farther and please leave us your feedback on this website link
                                    but if RCD does not
                                    reset than you
                                    need to investigate more if you are an electrician and you are reading this text
                                    then you can understand
                                    next paragraph
                                    if you are not qualified electrician then you should call someone who can come and
                                    sort out this

                                    RCD stands for residual current device always this have 2 poles one is for live wire
                                    and another ball is
                                    or neutral wire
                                    a single-phase connection RCD is comparing current of live and neutral wires all the
                                    time if any of the
                                    wire's current
                                    is not equal to each other's it means live and neutral parts of RCD will sense it
                                    and that will cause
                                    the RCD to trip so
                                    single-phase and three-phase RCD work in the same manner in single-phase one wire is
                                    comparing to
                                    another but in
                                    three-phase 3 live wires are comparing to one neutral wire so it means what all
                                    current which current is
                                    going into the
                                    system it should return back but not the voltages actual energy is stored in
                                    voltages but the quantity
                                    of the current
                                    stays same so that's why the returning current should be equal to the entering
                                    current so RCD helps to
                                    detect any
                                    leakage current into the system so

                                    The main reason of using an RCD is to protect the user from electric shock in most
                                    of the cases if RCD
                                    is flipping due
                                    to the sockets then it means there is some problem inside the ring main or the Spur
                                    or the radial
                                    circuit of sockets it
                                    means that at some point into the ring main live or the Neutral wire is touching to
                                    the earth wire so
                                    because in the
                                    actual earth is a second potential difference point to live that is why the current
                                    flows towards the
                                    earth that is why
                                    the entering current is not returned to the Neutral wire that's why the RCD sensed
                                    the difference and so
                                    that made the
                                    RCD trip if that is not the case then RCD device is not installed correctly it means
                                    of your one of RCD
                                    wires are going
                                    into another RCD part.

                                    Is it protects you from electric shock and it's disconnecting just because your

                                    is removed or
                                    damaged or one of your appliances is making your RCD to trip

                                    so for example if any of the live wire touches with your metal parts or any of your
                                    appliance metal body
                                    comes live just
                                    because all the appliances and the metal parts are bonded with earth wire due to
                                    that earth wire
                                    receives a voltage so
                                    that RCD senses that some of your metal parts are electrically Live and some current
                                    is leaking from
                                    metal parts so that
                                    it trips to protect you from electric shock so try to unplug all the appliances into
                                    your house and try
                                    to reset your
                                    RCD and it will help to solve your problem if that doesn’t help turn off all the MCB
                                    and turn on the
                                    main switch and
                                    both RCD you will be able to turn on now turn on MCB one by one make note which MCB
                                    is going down the
                                    RCD leave that off
                                    and turn on rest of it now you need local electricians to identify that problem
                                    permanently.

                                    So all appliances which are made of the metal body all the appliances are connected
                                    to the earth wires
                                    as well so if
                                    anybody is working and if your appliance metal body is not under an influence of
                                    voltage you're RCD will
                                    not trip but as
                                    soon as your appliance metal body receives a voltage then it will cause the RCD to
                                    trip to protect you
                                    from an electric
                                    shock so try to disconnect that applies and try to turn on your electrics again if
                                    the fuse box RCD
                                    allows you to turn
                                    on then it's fine and discontinues that appliance but if it doesn't work then there
                                    is some problem
                                    inside your wire so
                                    you need to call a lighting electrician to sort out this problem

                    when It comes to fuse-box repair and consumer unit repair most of the time problems are related to
                    RCD repair
                    normally RCD trips due to power plug sockets and that type of fault effects all the lights and blubs
                    sometimes
                    lights flicker in property that is not due to RCD fault that is the reason of lose connection if
                    that is happing in
                    your property then you should get it checked by certified electrician and ask them to carry out one
                    EICR which
                    stands for Electrical Installation Condition Report and that EICR will be carried out according to
                    the current UK
                    regulations BS 7671 that is Wiring Regulation and latest regulations which are released in 2018 your
                    whole property
                    must comply with 18th edition here are some EICR codes meanings which can help you identify problems
                    first one is C1
                    = Dangerous and Immediate action needed 2nd one is C2 = potentially dangerous and action needed
                    urgently 3rd one is
                    C3 = improvement required if there is any problem and last one FI means = future investigation
                    needed urgently most
                    of the EICR problems originates from the unsafe fuse-box which should be upgraded to RCD protected
                    metal consumer
                    unit that consumer unit will protect you from any potential electric shock some times EICR fails due
                    to wiring
                    condition and wiring condition means condition of the wires insulation is not good and insulation
                    resistance is low
                    the resistant means condition of the wires is bad on the other hand higher the insulation resistance
                    means good
                    condition ideally insulation resistant should be infinite at 500 Volt DC test if insulation
                    resistant is continually
                    low then it means your property needs a rewire but it is always best to get an electrical safety
                    certificate before
                    doing any upgrades or replacements in electrical system most of the time kitchen is very important
                    area of you house
                    or property most of the times kitchen fuses are blown or kitchen breaker or MCB trips due to any
                    faulty appliance in
                    the kitchen if that happens with any appliance please you should unplug your appliances switching
                    them off is not
                    enough because if you are switching only live wire will get disconnect neutral and earth wires don’t
                    get disconnect
                    so you need to unplug all of your appliances and then try to turn on your RCD it will turn on if
                    there is no fault
                    in wires but if there is any fault then you will need an electrician

                    We plan our lives with keeping worst scenarios in mind. Most of us keep backup financial funds for
                    rainy days and we
                    make sure that we will pass through any emergency. However, emergencies in lives needs to be
                    accessed before they

                    occur as they might
                    happen and we have to deal with it. We can only take precautions to avoid them even then they might
                    occur without
                    prior notice.
